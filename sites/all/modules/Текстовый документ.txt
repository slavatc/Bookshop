Привет,

вот на игнлише:
Here is a test task that sounds more like a mini-project but covers the most important areas of Drupal
and is more a site-building task (configuration + themeing)

Business goal: create a site "On-line book catalog" with the following features:

Book management
Site editor (content manager) can add/update/delete books. Book is a content type with the following fields:
-+ Title
-+Description
-+Cover (image)
-+ Author
-+ Year of publication
-+ Category (like "Fiction, Sci-Fi, Scientific publications etc"), only one is allowed
- Related books (link to another book on the site)
- +External link (probably to electronic version, online book-store etc.)

Site editor can manage "Book categories".

Site features
Site visitors can:
-+ register themselves
- +search for books using a search bar
-+ login using a login box, logout
- +view book details (includes accessing related books and external links from book view page)
- +leave a review (comment on books content)
- +rate a book
-+ add to bookmarks
- contact site administation

Frontend details
Frontpage contains
- +login box (or logout link depending on the status)
- +latest books - a box with a list of books that have been recently added

Search results page contains:
- +search form
- list of books found, with covers, title and short description. Search result item lead to book view page

Book view page contains:
- Complete book information
- Review/commenting boxes
- List of the books from the same category (5 items, sorted by title)

All of the pages contain:
- search box
- main menu that lists all of the book categories and allows to see all of the books from a category
- secondary menu:
 - About - page with a short info about the site
 - Contact  - a page with contact form

UX requirements
There is no strict layout of site pages. It's up to you to find
appropriate Drupal theme and decide on block positioning. Use your creativity and do not forget about
usability certainly.

Special requirements
The site can be installed from modules with all of the structure exported using features module.
Any page of the site (frontpage, search results, book view) should be easy to customize
i.e. content block placement can be reorganized using panels module.

As an additional task we could ask to:
- create a browsebar-like widget (a carousel view of certain books) (check JS knowledge)
- create a module that fetches book information from an online book database (http://isbndb.com/docs/api/) (check PHP/module development knowledge)
